# 📒 Ansible Role: noteapp

An Ansible Galaxy role that deploys a simple Flask-based note-taking web application on Linux hosts (tested on Amazon Linux 2023). This role automates the installation, configuration, and management of a minimal note-taking app using Flask and SQLite.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Installs required packages (Python 3, Flask, SQLite)
- ✅ Deploys `app.py` and `index.html`
- ✅ Initializes an SQLite database
- ✅ Sets up a `systemd` service to auto-start the app
- ✅ App listens on port **80**
- ✅ Compatible with dynamic EC2 inventory

---

## 🧾 Requirements

- Ansible 2.10+
- Python 3 on target machines
- Systemd-based Linux distro (Amazon Linux 2023, RHEL, CentOS, etc.)
- Port 80 open in security group (for web access)

---

## 📦 Role Variables

No variables are required by default. You may optionally override:

```yaml
noteapp_app_dir: /opt/noteapp
noteapp_port: 80

⚙️ Setup Steps
1. ✅ Prepare Environment
Launch two EC2 instances (Amazon Linux 2023):

controller → where Ansible runs

agent → where the Flask app is deployed

SSH into controller:

bash

sudo dnf install -y python3
pip3 install ansible
ansible --version
2. ✅ Create and Build Your Role

mkdir ansible-project && cd ansible-project
ansible-galaxy init noteapp
Populate:

tasks/main.yml

files/app.py

files/noteapp.service

templates/index.html

meta/main.yml

3. ✅ Create the Deployment Playbook
deploy.yml:


- name: Deploy Flask Note Taking App
  hosts: all
  become: true

  roles:
    - salwatamer-max.noteapp
4. ✅ Run the Playbook
If you're using EC2 dynamic inventory:


ansible-playbook -i aws_ec2.yaml deploy.yml
🌐 Accessing the App
Once deployed successfully, open a browser and navigate to:


http://<your-ec2-public-ip>/
You should see the Note Taking App UI.
